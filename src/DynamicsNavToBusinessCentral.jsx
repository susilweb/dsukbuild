                  Why Should You Upgrade Dynamics NAV To Business Central?
                </h2>
                <p>
                  After the 2018 upgrade, you might be in a dilemma about
                  whether to upgrade your current version of NAV to Business
                  Central or not. You must be surrounded by several questions
                  like time to upgrade, cost of the upgrade, implementation
                  process, and more.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The answer is simple; if you need enhanced performance and
                  scalability, an improved user experience, advanced automation
                  features and greater flexibility, you must upgrade to D365
                  Business Central.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Business Central is highly scalable, so it can grow with your
                  business as your needs change. And because it is cloud-based,
                  it is easy to deploy and use, with no need for complex
                  on-premises infrastructure.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Thus, upgrading an outdated NAV version to Business Central
                  can help businesses unlock new levels of productivity,
                  security and efficiency.

                          Unlike Dynamics NAV, Business Central can be
                          customized to fit the specific needs of your business.
                          You can tailor the interface, add or remove features,
                          and even integrate with other business applications.
                          By customizing Business Central, you can create a
                          solution that is uniquely suited to your company's
                          needs. Such customization help businesses perform
                          hectic tasks in simple ways, increasing overall
                          efficiency and growth. If you're looking to customize
                          process, layouts, reports, themes and more, you can

                          Business Central is a cloud-based solution, which
                          means it's much more scalable and flexible than NAV.
                          It's also easier to customize and integrate with other
                          applications. If you have to increase the NAV's server
                          hardware due to the increasing workload, you have to
                          invest a lot of money and resources and this is not
                          the case with Dynamics 365 Business Central.{" "}
